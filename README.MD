I am using this template from the ionic framework: ionic start ionic-admob-facebookads-mediation sidemenu --cordova --type=angular

I have added the Admob plugin I am using: https://github.com/admob-plus/admob-plus

What I need is: integrate Facebook ads on this app and do mediation so that the ads would compete between both ad networks.
Since I already use Admob, the ideal would use Admob mediation.
